# Gold_Price_Prediction
# Overview
This repository contains a Python project for predicting gold prices using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes two main models: Random Forest Regressor and SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average). The Random Forest Regressor is employed for its flexibility in handling complex relationships, while SARIMA is a time series model designed to capture seasonality.

# Model Comparison: 
Random Forest Regressor:
1. Utilizes an ensemble of decision trees for predicting gold prices.
2. Provides flexibility in capturing complex relationships.

SARIMA:
1. A time series model designed to handle seasonality in sequential data.
2. Suitable for capturing patterns in time-dependent gold price fluctuations.
